# Aircraft Safety Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to help our company select low-risk aircraft for business use. By examining data from 1962 to 2023, we provide insights into injury sverity, phases of flights, aircraft category, aircraft damage, number of injuries (either fatal, seriuos, minor or uninjured), engine types, number of engines across various aircraft models and makes.

## Business Understanding

### Stakeholders
- *Head of Aviation Division*: Interested in selecting safe aircraft models for purchase.
- *Safety Compliance Team*: Concerned with ensuring regulatory compliance and minimizing risks.
- *Financial Analysts*: Focused on cost-effectiveness related to aircraft operations.

### Key Business Questions
1. Which aircraft models have the lowest injury severity rates?
2. What factors contribute to accidents in different aircraft types?
3. How can we use historical data to predict future safety trends?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data
The primary source of data for this project is the NTSB aviation accident database, which includes detailed records of aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023.

### Description of Data
- *Dataset Features*: Includes variables such as aircraft model, accident year, injury severity, engine types, and number of injuries (either fatal, seriuos, minor or uninjured).
- *Size*: The dataset consists of 565032 number of records and 64 number of features.

### Visualizations
Here are the key visualizations that summarize our findings:

1. *Injury Severity*  
   ![Injury Severity]  
   Description: This visualization shows the distribution of injury severity across different aircraft makes and models and also broad phase of flight. It highlights  the rates of severe injuries from the highest injury sverity to lowest.

2. *Aircraft Make and Models*  
   ![Aircraft Make and Models] 
   Description: This chart analyzes the aircraft make and models that are frequently involved in accidents.

3. *Aircraft Category*  
   ![Aircraft Category]  
   Description: The visualization shows the aircraft category that is most frequently involved in accidents .

4. *Aircraft damage and number of injuries (either fatal, seriuos, minor or uninjured)*
    ![aircraft damage and number of injuries (either fatal, seriuos, minor or uninjured)]
    Description: by visualising both aircraft damage and number of injuries together, one can easily identify whether higher damage correlates with a greater number of injuries.

5. *Engine type*
    ![Engine type]
    Description: it helps to identify which engine type contribute the most to the accidents, allowing for focused safety improvements.

6. *Number of engines*
    ![Number of engines]
    Description: this visualisation helps in understanding whether multi-engine or single-engine aircrafts are associated with more injuries. 
## Conclusion

### Summary of Conclusions
1. *Injury Severity*: Specific aircraft makes and models have been identified as having significantly lower injury severity rates making them more suitable for purchase.Also, the phase of flights has played an important in this.
2. *Aircraft Make and Models*: Some aircraft makes and models have frequently been involved in accidents hence making them less suitable for purchase. 
3. *Aircraft Category*: Historical data trends indicate the most frequently involved aircrafts.The more the number of accidents the less suitable it is for purchase. 
4. *aircraft damage and number of injuries (either fatal, seriuos, minor or uninjured)*:The aircraft damage correlates with the number and type of injuries. The more the damage the more the injuries hence making them less suitable for purchase.
5. *Engine type*: this highlights critical areas for improvement in aviation safety and decision making hence contributing to a safer flights.
6. *Number of engines*: understanding how the number of engines impacts on the injury rates can lead to better safety decisions and a safer flight for everyone hence making them suitable for purchase.
